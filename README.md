QuoteHighlighter is a simple chrome app that let's you collect quotes/chunks of text that you come across online, picks a random one from your collection and shows it to you every time you open a new tab, instead of the default new tab page on chrome. 

Reasons to build this:
- Want something like this for my personal use. During the countless hours I spend online reading random stuff, I frequently come across things that I find are well written, or have some useful info, that I  note down in an ever growing txt file with the hope that I'll read through the list frequently. While I do keep adding to the list, I don't tend to read through it, so thought I'd find a way to remind me of these chunks of text regularly. Also, the default new tab on chrome is boring.

- While building Django apps I'd frequently be bothered by all the magic that happens behind the scenes. While digging through the source code does scratch that itch, I think reimplementing the wheel is a good way to truly grok  how things work. I hope to build a micro python web framework and a simple app on top of it for the chrome app to talk to. The micro framework will have routing and a bare bones template engine.
